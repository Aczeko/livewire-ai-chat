## üîé Overview
This is an AI chatbot using Livewire and ChatGPT.

It's using wire:stream to stream in ChatGPT responses as they arrive, by building a chat interface with Livewire.

Every message that is sent and every response is shown in the chat history. It also remembers the conversation context, though nothing is saved in a database. 
It's using the [OpenAI PHP API client](https://github.com/openai-php/client), that allows you to interact with the OpenAI API.

It also supports dark and light mode, depending on your system-preference.
